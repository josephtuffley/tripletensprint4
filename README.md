   - This bar chart shows the average sale price for vehicles across different conditions, such as `new`, `used`, etc.
   - Averages are calculated based on the `condition` column from the dataset.

2. **Average Price by Odometer (Grouped by 10,000 Miles)**:
   - This plot illustrates the average price broken down by odometer readings in increments of 10,000 miles.
   - Helps to identify trends, such as how price decreases as odometer readings increase, which can be helpful for pricing strategies.

Each graph visually explains pricing behavior for vehicles based on relevant factors.
